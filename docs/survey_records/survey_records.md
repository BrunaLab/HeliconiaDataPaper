Survey Records
================

# Tag Changes 

Field survey teams periodically change the tags attached to individual plants (e.g., if the tag becomes difficult to read or the tag is lost). Below is a record of these changes; these records are necessary when using the original data sheets to validate plant records. Updates of this log are noted on [NEWS.md](/NEWS.md); the complete log of tag changes (in .csv format) can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/BrunaLab/HeliconiaSurveys/blob/1649ea958df1fc2da0187693bca40ce38bebb759/survey_clean/tag_changes.csv).

# Treefalls

Survey teams documented treefalls in the demographic plots, including estimates of their extent. A .csv file with these observations can be  [downloaded here](https://github.com/BrunaLab/HeliconiaSurveys/blob/ca06ba6c501ad2bb6a43c6a6636cb09afccb5614/survey_clean/treefall_impacts.csv).

# Damage to Plants

Survey teams often recorded the identity of individual plants covered by palm fronds or damaged by tree branches.  A .csv file with these observations can be  [downloaded here](https://github.com/BrunaLab/HeliconiaSurveys/blob/ca06ba6c501ad2bb6a43c6a6636cb09afccb5614/survey_clean/treefall_impacts.csv).

# Survey Datasheets


Scanning and uploading of the original datasheets is ongoing; for now the datasheets for the 2002 survey of BDFFP Fragment 2018 (Dimona, 1-ha) can be downloaded [here](../survey_records/survey_sheets/Dimona1_2108_2002-compressed.pdf)
