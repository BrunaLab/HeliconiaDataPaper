# Tag Changes 

Field survey teams periodically change the tags attached to individual plants (e.g., if the tag becomes difficult to read or the tag is lost). Below is a record of these changes; these records are necessary when using the original data sheets to validate plant records. Updates of this log are noted on [NEWS.md](/NEWS.md)

# Treefalls

Survey teams documented treefalls in the demographic plots, including estimates of their extent.

- [Treefall Records](link) (.csv format).

# Damage to Plants

Survey teams often noted if individual plants were under inside treefalls, covered by palm fronds, or damaged by tree branches.
