Tag Changes
================

Field survey teams periodically change the tags attached to individual plants (e.g., if the tag becomes difficult to read or the tag is lost). Below is a record of these changes; these records are necessary when using the original data sheets to validate plant records. Updates of this log are noted on [NEWS.md](/NEWS.md); the complete log of tag changes (in .csv format) can be [seen and downloaded here](https://github.com/BrunaLab/HeliconiaSurveys/blob/master/data/survey_clean/tag_changes.csv).
