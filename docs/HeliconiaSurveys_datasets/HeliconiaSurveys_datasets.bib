Project Info:This dataset reports the number of seeds per fruit of Heliconia acuminata (Heliconiaceae) growing along trails in the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project in Manaus. All Heliconia species produce fruits with a maximum of three seeds. These data were used to report the average number of seeds produced per fruit and in demographic models of H. acuminata demography. See, e.g., :

File: Metadata\_Heliconia\_acuminata\_seedset\_ 2008.csv
Description: This file describes the number of seeds in each fruit collected from different plants at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project.
Methods: Plants were marked along trails at the BDFFP?s Reserve 1501 in 2008. Additional fruits were collected from unmarked plants in different BDFFP locations. Fruits were collected and individually scrubbed with a strainer to clean seeds.
Column Headings:Plant\_no: The temporary unique number used to identify plants during the collection. Some fruits were collected from unmarked plants that were encountered along trails while doing field work in Reserve 1501 or other locations; these are indicated with the location (e.g., Matrix\_Colosso) where they were collected. These are not necessarily from the sample plant, so they should not be used in estimates of total fruit or seed set per plant ? only those with unique ID numbers.No\_of\_seeds: Number of seeds in the fruitDate\_Collected: date the fruit was collected},
