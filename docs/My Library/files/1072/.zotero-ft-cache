Abstract
A trenching study was used to investigate above- and below-ground competition in a longleaf pine ( Pinus palustris P. Mill.) woodland. Trenched and nontrenched plots were replicated in the woodland matrix, at gap edges, and in gap centers representing a range of overstory stocking. One-half of each plot received a herbicide treatment to remove the understory. We monitored pine survival and growth, understory productivity, light level (gap fraction), and soil resources. The overstory facilitated pine seedling survival. Pine seedling growth was reduced as overstory stocking increased. Reduced growth of seedlings was also observed in gaps when the understory was left intact. Understory plants competed with seedlings by filling the root gaps that developed as a result of overstory disturbance. Hardwood growth increased in gaps, owing to decreased belowground competition with adult pines, while growth of herbaceous plants and pine seedlings increased with light availability. Large overstory gaps are not required to initiate regeneration in longleaf pine woodlands. Retaining overstory dispersed throughout the stand but variable in density, through single-tree selection approaches, may be an alternative to gap-based approaches. This approach would allow for the fuel continuity needed to sustain the frequent fire required to maintain the diversity characteristic of this type of woodland.
Résumé
Un dispositif de tranchées a été utilisé pour étudier la compétition aérienne et souterraine dans une station forestière dominée par le pin des marais ( Pinus palustris P. Mill.). Des placettes avec ou sans tranchées ont été répétées dans une matrice forestière, en bordure de trouées et au centre de trouées, ce qui correspondait à un gradient de densité relative du couvert. La moitié de chaque placette a été traitée à l’aide d’un herbicide pour éliminer les plantes du sous-étage. Nous avons suivi la survie et la croissance des pins, la productivité des plantes du sous-étage, la lumière (ouverture du couvert) et les ressources du sol. Les ouvertures dans le couvert dominant ont augmenté le taux de survie des semis de pin. La croissance des semis de pin a été réduite par une augmentation de la densité relative du couvert dominant. Une diminution de la croissance des semis a aussi été observée dans les trouées où les plantes de sous-étage n’avaient pas été éliminées. Les plantes du sous-étage venaient en compétition avec les semis en comblant les espaces exempts de racines qui sont apparus après la perturbation de l’étage dominant. La croissance d’espèces feuillues a augmenté dans les trouées à la suite d’une diminution de la compétition racinaire avec les pins adultes, alors que les plantes herbacées et les semis de pin ont augmenté leur croissance avec une augmentation de la disponibilité de la lumière. Les grandes trouées dans le couvert dominant ne sont pas nécessaires pour l’établissement de la régénération dans les stations forestières dominées par le pin des marais. Le maintien d’un couvert dispersé à travers le peuplement, mais de densité variable, à l’aide d’une approche de jardinage par pied d’arbre peut constituer une solution de remplacement aux approches basées sur les trouées. Cette approche favoriserait la production régulière des combustibles nécessaires pour soutenir les feux fréquents requis pour maintenir la diversité caractéristique de ce type de forêt.
