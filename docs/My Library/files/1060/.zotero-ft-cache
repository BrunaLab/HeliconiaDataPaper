Abstract

Question: The Janzen‐Connell hypothesis predicts that herbivores and pathogens prevent seedlings from establishing in dense patches near adult conspecifics. Although many studies have investigated the Janzen‐Connell hypothesis, the environmental context – local or regional – in which juveniles establish is often overlooked. The objectives of this study were: (1) to evaluate Janzen‐Connell effects in contrasting environments, and (2) to incorporate microsite variation into the study of this hypothesis.

Location: Pacaya‐Samiria Reserve, Peru.

Methods: I assessed seedling performance of two tree species, Garcinia macrophylla and Xylopia micans , during one growing season. In an observational study, mortality and growth rates were regressed against distance to the nearest adult conspecific, conspecific seedling density, heterospecific plant density, and several abiotic variables in upland and floodplain forests. Field and shadehouse experiments were used to isolate distance‐ and density‐dependent effects.

Results: Contrary to predictions, seedling survivorship increased in the presence of conspecific seedlings ( Garcinia ) and heterospecific understory plants ( Garcinia and Xylopia ) in the observational study. Survivorship in the field experiment, however, was unaffected by conspecific seedling density or adult proximity. In the shadehouse, Garcinia growth rates were highest in floodplain soils collected near adult conspecifics, but mortality was unrelated to the soil's habitat or proximity to an adult.

Conclusions: The positive density dependence found in this study could have been produced by: (1) environmental factors that increase both density and survivorship, or (2) interspecific facilitation, if heterospecifics reduce herbivore or pathogen pressure on the focal species. Such interactions could help explain species coexistence in tropical forests.

Supporting Information

Appendix S1. Summary of abiotic and biotic variables measured in seedling plots in the observational study (mean±S.D.) and significance of the difference between upland and floodplain sites for both species.

Appendix S2. The influence of abiotic conditions on heterospecific sapling density in Xylopia micans plots and heterospecific seedling density in Garicinia macrophylla plots. All parameters marked n.s. (not significant) had p >0.1 in a backward elimination regression based on plot‐level measurements of density. Leaf litter depth, bulk density and soil moisture were not analyzed in Garcinia plots because of insufficient sampling and are indicated with N/A. These analyses were based on the raw data, not standardized data. The data were modeled using a Poisson distribution for heterospecific density, and nesting plots around trees (Glimmix procedure in SAS, using a random statement for tree).

Appendix S3. Garcinia seedling relative growth rate in the shadehouse experiment (mean±S.E.). Letters indicate significant differences between treatments.
