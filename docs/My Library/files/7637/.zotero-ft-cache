Abstract

Scholarly publishing is hegemonic: a handful of international, commercial publishers dominate. Because the system favors English-language authors at well-resourced institutions, many academics and scientists are left out. But what if there was an alternate vision for scholarship that focuses on research in local languages, where research addresses issues of local concern, and open access occurs without fees to authors? In this presentation, we’ll learn more about initiatives in other countries, why bibliodiversity and local research is so important, and more about how local research is supported internationally.

Latin and South America have proven that they can “do it for themselves.” Rejecting the neo-Colonial model, organizations including SciELO, CLACSO-REDALyC, and others have created community-based publishing infrastructure that has been adapted outside of the region, for example, South Africa. With the advent of Plan S, a European-based initiative to trigger a rapid transition to open access, librarians and others need to advocate for the Latin American model of community-owned infrastructure in opposition to the further corporatization of open access by commercial publishers that is fostered by Plan S.
