## Satellite Image - BDFFP


<img src="https://github.com/BrunaLab/HeliconiaSurveys/blob/master/docs/maps/images/bdffpsat.jpg"/>

Satellite image of the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (ca. 1995) showing the location of the _Heliconia_ Demographic Plots. Plots are located in Continuous Forest (CF1-CF6) or Forest Fragments (FF1-FF7), both of which are dark green. Light green areas are regenerating forest, while red indicates pasture. The BDFFP is located ~70 km north of Manaus, Brazil (inset map). For additional details on each plot see Table 1 of Bruna et al.

## _Heliconia_ Demographic Plots

### 1-ha Fragments

Schematic of the _Heliconia_ Demographic Plots in the BDFFP 1-hectare forest fragment reserves (note: not to scale). The rectangles filled with a letter-number combination (i.e., F-3, A-2, E-2) are coordinate stakes marking the permanent plots of the BDFFP Phytodemographic Project (Rankin-de-Mérona et al. 1992).

### 10-ha Fragments

Schematic of the _Heliconia_ Demographic Plots in the BDFFP 10-ha forest fragment reserves (note: not to scale). The rectangles filled with a letter-number combination (i.e., I-8, J-8) are coordinate stakes marking the permanent plots of the BDFFP Phytodemographic Project (Rankin-de-Mérona et al. 1992).


### Continuous Forest

_Heliconia_ Demographic Plots in Continuous Forest (note: not to scale). Rectangles with a letter-number combination (i.e., L-40, J-40, C-1, C-2) are coordinate stakes marking permanent plots of the BDFFP Phytodemographic Project (Rankin-de-Mérona et al. 1992).
