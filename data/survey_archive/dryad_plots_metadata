A complete description of the data set, how the data were collected and validated, and other relevant information are in the following publications:

Bruna,E.M., M.Uriarte, M.Rosa Darrigo, P.Rubim, C.F.Jurinitz, E.R.Scott, O.Ferreira da Silva, & W.John Kress. 2023. Demography of the understory herb Heliconia acuminata (Heliconiaceae) in an experimentally fragmented tropical landscape. Ecology.

We report 11 years (1998-2009) of demographic data from populations of the Amazonian understory herb _Heliconia acuminata_ (LC Rich.) found at Brazil's Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP). The resulting data set comprises > >66,000 plant x year records of 8586 plants, including 3464 seedlings that became established after the initial census. Seven populations were in experimentally isolated fragments (one in each of four 1-ha fragments and one in each of three 10-ha fragments), with the remaining six populations in continuous forest. Each population was in a 50 x 100 m permanent plot, with the distance between plots ranging from 500 m-60 km. 

This data set describes the demographic plots in which surveys were conducted.
