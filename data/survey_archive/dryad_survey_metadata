A complete description of the data set, how the data were collected and validated, and other relevant information are in the following publications:

Bruna,E.M., M.Uriarte, M.Rosa Darrigo, P.Rubim, C.F.Jurinitz, E.R.Scott, O.Ferreira da Silva, & W.John Kress. 2023. Demography of the understory herb Heliconia acuminata (Heliconiaceae) in an experimentally fragmented tropical landscape. Ecology.


This file comprises 11 years (1998-2009) of demographic data from populations of the Amazonian understory herb _Heliconia acuminata_ (LC Rich.) found at Brazil's Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP). The dataset comprises >66,000 plant x year records of 8586 plants, including 3464 seedlings established after the first census. Seven populations were in experimentally isolated fragments (one in each of four 1-ha fragments and one in each of three 10-ha fragments), with the remaining six populations in continuous forest. Each population was in a $50\times100$m permanent plot, with the distance between plots ranging from 500 m-60 km. The plants in each plot were censused annually, at which time we recorded, identified, marked, and measured new seedlings, identified any previously marked plants that died, and recorded the size of surviving individuals. Each plot was also surveyed 4-5 times during the flowering season to identify reproductive plants and record the number of inflorescences each produced.

## Description of the data and file structure

- Format and storage mode: ASCII text, comma delimited. No compression scheme used.

- Header information: The first row of the file contains the variable names.

- Variables:

-- plot_id: Plot in which plant is located (values: FF1-FF7, CF1-CF6)

-- subplot: Subplot in which plant is located  (values: A1-E10 except in CF3, where F6-J101)

-- plant_id: Unique ID no. assigned to plant (values: range = 1-8660, units: number, precision: 1)

-- tag_number: Number on tag attached to plant (values: range = 1-3751, units: number, precision: 1)

-- year: Calendar year of survey (values: range = 1998-2009, units: year, precision: 1))

-- shts: No. of shoots when surveyed (values: range = 0-24, units: shoots, precision: 1, NA: data missing)

-- ht: Plant height when surveyed (values: range = 0-226, units: cm, precision: 1, NA: data missing)

-- infl: No. of inflorescences (if flowering) (values: range = 1-7, units: shoots, precision: 1, NA: data missing)

-- recorded_sdlg: New seedling (values: TRUE, FALSE)

-- adult_no_tag: Established (i.e., post-seedling) individual without tag (values: TRUE, FALSE)

-- treefall_status: Plant found under fallen tree crown, branches, or leaf litter at time of survey (values: branch = under fallen tree limbs tree = under tree crown or fallen trees litter = under accumulated leaf-litter NA = not relevant or no observation recorded )

-- census_status: Plant status in a census (values: measured = alive, measured dead = died prior to census missing = not found during census)
