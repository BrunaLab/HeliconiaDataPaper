## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r loaddata, echo=FALSE}
HA<-
  read.csv(
    "./output/Ha_survey_with_Zombies.csv",
    dec = ".",
    header = TRUE,
    sep = ",",
    check.names = FALSE
  )
colnames(HA)
```

```{r}
library(xtable)
x<-seq(1:10)
y<-seq(21:30)+500
xy<-as.data.frame(cbind(x,y))
table<-xtable(xy, type="html")
print(table,type='html')
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r test, echo=FALSE}
hist(HA$ht)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
