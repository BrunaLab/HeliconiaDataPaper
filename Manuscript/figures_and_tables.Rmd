## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r plot_info, echo=FALSE}

plot_info <-
  read.csv(
    "./data_raw/heliconia_plot_descriptors.csv",
    dec = ".",
    header = TRUE,
    sep = ",",
    check.names = FALSE
  )

knitr::kable(plot_info, format="markdown")

```

```{r plants_per_plot, echo=FALSE}
heliconia_clean <-
  read.csv(
    "../data_clean/Ha_survey_with_Zombies.csv",
    dec = ".",
    header = TRUE,
    sep = ",",
    check.names = FALSE
  )

total_plants_per_plot <- heliconia_clean %>% group_by(size,plot,HA.plot) %>% summarise(count = n_distinct(tag_number)) %>% arrange(size)
knitr::kable(total_plants_per_plot, format="markdown")
```
