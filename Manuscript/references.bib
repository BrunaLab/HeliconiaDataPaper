We used spatially explicit neighborhood models together with data from 10 0.5-ha mapped census plots in a fragmented landscape spanning 1000 km2 to (1) evaluate the relative importance of seed production, dispersal, and safe-site limitation for the recruitment of the understory herb Heliconia acuminata; and (2) determine how these processes differ between fragments and continuous forests. Our analyses demonstrated a large degree of variation in seed production, dispersal, and establishment among and within the 10 study plots. Seed production limitation was strong but only at small spatial scales. Average dispersal distance was less than 4 m, leading to severe dispersal limitation at most sites. Overall, safe-site limitation was the most important constraint on seedling establishment. Fragmentation led to a more heterogeneous light environment with negative consequences for seedling establishment but had little effect on seed production or dispersal. These results suggest that the effects of fragmentation on abiotic processes may be more important than the disruption of biotic interactions in driving biodiversity loss in tropical forests, at least for some functional groups. These effects may be common when the matrix surrounding fragments contains enough tree cover to enable movement of dispersers and pollinators.},

	abstract = {Seed dispersal is a crucial component of plant population dynamics. Human landscape modiﬁcations, such as habitat destruction and fragmentation, can alter the abundance of fruiting plants and animal dispersers, foraging rates, vector movement, and the composition of the disperser community, all of which can singly or in concert affect seed dispersal. Here, we quantify and tease apart the effects of landscape conﬁguration, namely, fragmentation of primary forest and the composition of the surrounding forest matrix, on individual components of seed dispersal of Heliconia acuminata, an Amazonian understory herb. First we identiﬁed the effects of landscape conﬁguration on the abundance of fruiting plants and six bird disperser species. Although highly variable in space and time, densities of fruiting plants were similar in continuous forest and fragments. However, the two largestbodied avian dispersers were less common or absent in small fragments. Second, we determined whether fragmentation affected foraging rates. Fruit removal rates were similar and very high across the landscape, suggesting that Heliconia fruits are a key resource for small frugivores in this landscape. Third, we used radiotelemetry and statistical models to quantify how landscape conﬁguration inﬂuences vector movement patterns. Bird dispersers ﬂew farther and faster, and perched longer in primary relative to secondary forests. One species also altered its movement direction in response to habitat boundaries between primary and secondary forests. Finally, we parameterized a simulation model linking data on fruit density and disperser abundance and behavior with empirical estimates of seed retention times to generate seed dispersal patterns in two hypothetical landscapes. Despite clear changes in bird movement in response to landscape conﬁguration, our simulations demonstrate that these differences had negligible effects on dispersal distances. However, small fragments had reduced densities of Turdus albicollis, the largest-bodied disperser and the only one to both regurgitate and defecate seeds. This change in Turdus abundance acted together with lower numbers of fruiting plants in small fragments to decrease the probability of long-distance dispersal events from small patches. These ﬁndings emphasize the importance of foraging style for seed dispersal and highlight the primacy of habitat size relative to spatial conﬁguration in preserving biotic interactions.},

	abstract = {Deforestation often results in landscapes where remaining forest habitat is highly fragmented, with remnants of different sizes embedded in an often highly contrasting matrix. Local extinction of species from individual fragments is common, but the demographic mechanisms underlying these extinctions are poorly understood. It is often hypothesized that altered environmental conditions in fragments drive declines in reproduction, recruitment, or survivorship. The Amazon basin, in addition to experiencing continuing fragmentation, is experiencing climate change-related increases in the frequency and intensity of droughts and unusually wet periods. Whether plant populations in tropical forest fragments are particularly susceptible to extremes in precipitation remains unclear. Most studies of plants in fragments are relatively short (1-6 years), focus on a single life-history stage, and often do not compare to populations in continuous forest. Even fewer studies consider delayed effects of climate on demographic vital rates despite the importance of delayed effects in studies that consider them. Using a decade of demographic and climate data from an experimentally fragmented landscape in the Central Amazon, we assess the effects of climate on populations of an understory herb (Heliconia acuminata, Heliconiaceae). We used distributed lag nonlinear models to understand the delayed effects of climate (measured as standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index, SPEI) on survival, growth, and flowering. We detected delayed effects of climate up to 36 months. Extremes in SPEI in the previous year reduced survival, drought in the wet season 8-11 months prior to the February census increased growth, and drought two dry seasons prior increased flowering probability. Effects of extremes in precipitation on survival and growth were more pronounced in forest fragments compared to continuous forest. The complex delayed effects of climate and habitat fragmentation in our study point to the importance of long-term demography experiments in understanding the effects of anthropogenic change on plant populations.},

	abstract = {Secondary forests are an increasingly common feature in tropical landscapes worldwide and understanding their regeneration is necessary to design effective restoration strategies. It has previously been shown that the woody species community in secondary forests can follow different successional pathways according to the nature of past human activities in the area, yet little is known about patterns of herbaceous species diversity in secondary forests with different histories of land use. We compared the diversity and abundance of herbaceous plant communities in two types of Central Amazonian secondary forests—those regenerating on pastures created by felling and burning trees and those where trees were felled only. We also tested if plant density and species richness in secondary forests are related to proximity to primary forest. In comparison with primary forest sites, forests regenerating on non-burned habitats had lower herbaceous plant density and species richness than those on burned ones. However, species composition and abundance in non-burned stands were more similar to those of primary forest, whereas several secondary forest specialist species were found in burned stands. In both non-burned and burned forests, distance from the forest edge was not related to herbaceous density and species richness. Overall, our results suggest that the natural regeneration of herbaceous species in secondary tropical forests is dependent on a site’s postclearing treatment. We recommend evaluating the land history of a site prior to developing and implementing a restoration strategy, as this will inﬂuence the biological template on which restoration efforts are overlaid.},

We quantiﬁed responsiveness using elasticities of the long-term population growth rate predicted by stochastic projection matrix models. Short-lived species (insects and annual plants and algae) are predicted to be more strongly (and negatively) affected by increasing vital rate variability relative to longer-lived species (perennial plants, birds, ungulates). Taxonomic afﬁliation has little power to explain sensitivity to increasing variability once longevity has been taken into account. Our results highlight the potential vulnerability of short-lived species to an increasingly variable climate, but also suggest that problems associated with short-lived undesirable species (agricultural pests, disease vectors, invasive weedy plants) may be exacerbated in regions where climate variability decreases.},

	abstract = {We synthesize ﬁndings to date from the world’s largest and longest-running experimental study of habitat fragmentation, located in central Amazonia. Over the past 32 years, Amazonian forest fragments ranging from 1 to 100 ha have experienced a wide array of ecological changes. Edge effects have been a dominant driver of fragment dynamics, strongly affecting forest microclimate, tree mortality, carbon storage, fauna, and other aspects of fragment ecology. However, edge-effect intensity varies markedly in space and time, and is inﬂuenced by factors such as edge age, the number of nearby edges, and the adjoining matrix of modiﬁed vegetation surrounding fragments. In our study area, the matrix has changed markedly over the course of the study (evolving from large cattle pastures to mosaics of abandoned pasture and regrowth forest) and this in turn has strongly inﬂuenced fragment dynamics and faunal persistence. Rare weather events, especially windstorms and droughts, have further altered fragment ecology. In general, populations and communities of species in fragments are hyperdynamic relative to nearby intact forest. Some edge and fragment-isolation effects have declined with a partial recovery of secondary forests around fragments, but other changes, such as altered patterns of tree recruitment, are ongoing. Fragments are highly sensitive to external vicissitudes, and even small changes in local land-management practices may drive fragmented ecosystems in markedly different directions. The effects of fragmentation are likely to interact synergistically with other anthropogenic threats such as logging, hunting, and especially ﬁre, creating an even greater peril for the Amazonian biota.},

We tested (A) whether annual growth rates were lower in fragments than in continuous forest, and (B) whether cumulative growth rates of plants that survived the entire period were lower in fragments. While mean annual growth rates were often lower in fragments, differences were not signiﬁcant in any year. After 10 years, however, the cumulative effect was that plants in fragments were signiﬁcantly smaller. This had a clear demographic consequence – plants in fragments produced fewer inﬂorescences than plants in continuous forest. Our results demonstrate that chronic reduced individual growth may be an important mechanism contributing to reduced population viability in fragmented forests, and that negative demographic consequences of fragmentation for plants can take years to manifest themselves.},

	abstract = {Habitat loss is a primary threat to biodiversity across the planet, yet contentious debate has ensued on the importance of habitat fragmentation ‘per se’ (i.e., altered spatial configuration of habitat for a given amount of habitat loss). Based on a review of landscape-scale investigations, Fahrig (2017; Ecological responses to habitat fragmentation per se. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 48:1-23) reports that biodiversity responses to habitat fragmentation ‘per se’ are more often positive rather than negative and concludes that the widespread belief in negative fragmentation effects is a ‘zombie idea’. We show that Fahrig's conclusions are drawn from a narrow and potentially biased subset of available evidence, which ignore much of the observational, experimental and theoretical evidence for negative effects of altered habitat configuration. We therefore argue that Fahrig's conclusions should be interpreted cautiously as they could be misconstrued by policy makers and managers, and we provide six arguments why they should not be applied in conservation decision-making. Reconciling the scientific disagreement, and informing conservation more effectively, will require research that goes beyond statistical and correlative approaches. This includes a more prudent use of data and conceptual models that appropriately partition direct vs indirect influences of habitat loss and altered spatial configuration, and more clearly discriminate the mechanisms underpinning any changes. Incorporating these issues will deliver greater mechanistic understanding and more predictive power to address the conservation issues arising from habitat loss and fragmentation.},

	abstract = {Background: Matrix models are widely used to study the dynamics and demography of populations. An important but overlooked issue is how the number of individuals sampled influences estimates of the population growth rate (l) calculated with matrix models. Even unbiased estimates of vital rates do not ensure unbiased estimates of l–Jensen’s Inequality implies that even when the estimates of the vital rates are accurate, small sample sizes lead to biased estimates of l due to increased sampling variance. We investigated if sampling variability and the distribution of sampling effort among size classes lead to biases in estimates of l. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using data from a long-term field study of plant demography, we simulated the effects of sampling variance by drawing vital rates and calculating l for increasingly larger populations drawn from a total population of 3842 plants. We then compared these estimates of l with those based on the entire population and calculated the resulting bias. Finally, we conducted a review of the literature to determine the sample sizes typically used when parameterizing matrix models used to study plant demography. Conclusions/Significance: We found significant bias at small sample sizes when survival was low (survival = 0.5), and that sampling with a more-realistic inverse J-shaped population structure exacerbated this bias. However our simulations also demonstrate that these biases rapidly become negligible with increasing sample sizes or as survival increases. For many of the sample sizes used in demographic studies, matrix models are probably robust to the biases resulting from sampling variance of vital rates. However, this conclusion may depend on the structure of populations or the distribution of sampling effort in ways that are unexplored. We suggest more intensive sampling of populations when individual survival is low and greater sampling of stages with high elasticities.},

	abstract = {Ecologists commonly use matrix models to study the population dynamics of plants. Most studies of plant demography use plot-based methods to collect data, in part, because mapped individuals are easier to relocate in subsequent surveys and survey methods can be standardized among sites. However, there is tremendous variation among studies, both in terms of plot arrangement and the total area sampled. In addition, there has been little discussion of how alternative sampling arrangements influence estimates of population growth rates (lambda) calculated with matrix models. We surveyed the literature to determine what sampling designs are most used in studies of plant demography using matrix models. We then used simulations of three common sampling techniques-using a single randomly placed plot, multiple randomly placed plots, and systematically distributed plots-to evaluate how these alternative strategies influenced the precision of estimates of lambda. These simulations were based on long-term demographic data collected on 13 populations of the Amazonian understory herb Heliconia acuminate (Heliconiaceae). We found that the method used to collect data did not affect the bias or precision of estimates in our system-a surprising result, since the advantage in efficiency that is gained from systematic sampling is a well-known result from sampling theory. Because the statistical advantage of systematic sampling is most evident when there is spatial structure in demographic vital rates, we attribute this result to the lack of spatially structured vital rates in our focal populations. Given the likelihood of spatial autocorrelation in most ecological systems, we advocate sampling with a systematic grid of plots in each study site, as well as that researchers ensure that enough area is sampled-both within and across sites-to encompass the range of spatial variation in plant survival, growth, and reproduction.},

We used Bayesian genetic analyses to characterize parentage and propagule dispersal in Heliconia acuminata L. C. Richard (Heliconiaceae), a common Amazonian understory plant that is pollinated and dispersed by birds. We studied these processes in two continuous forest sites and three 1-ha fragments in Brazil's Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project. These sites showed variation in the density of H. acuminata. Ten microsatellite markers were used to genotype flowering adults and seedling recruits and to quantify realized pollen and seed dispersal distances, immigration of propagules from outside populations, and reproductive dominance among parents. We tested whether gene dispersal is more dependent on fragmentation or density of reproductive plants. Low plant densities were associated with elevated immigration rates and greater propagule dispersal distances. Reproductive dominance among inside-plot parents was higher for low-density than for high-density populations. Elevated local flower and fruit availability is probably leading to spatially more proximal bird foraging and propagule dispersal in areas with high density of reproductive plants. Nevertheless, genetic diversity, inbreeding coefficients and fine-scale spatial genetic structure were similar across populations, despite differences in gene dispersal. This result may indicate that the opposing processes of longer dispersal events in low-density populations vs. higher diversity of contributing parents in high-density populations balance the resulting genetic outcomes and prevent genetic erosion in small populations and fragments.},

By assessing the population structure of a common herb ( Heliconia acuminata) in an experimentally fragmented landscape in the central Amazon, we tested the predictions that fragmentation could reduce population density, alter population structure, and reduce reproductive effort. Population density in continuous forest varied six-fold, some areas having high density and others low density. Population density in small fragments and on the edges of large fragments was often low, but it was within the range of densities found in continuous forest, and the difference between locations was not significant. Heliconia populations in forest fragments were skewed toward smaller demographic size classes, however. Because reproduction in H. acuminata is positively correlated with plant size, these shifts were predicted to result in fewer flowering plants in forest fragments. The proportion of the population flowering in forest fragments and continuous forest was not significantly different, although there was a trend toward proportionately greater flowering in continuous forest. For plants that did flower, per-individual reproductive success (measured as developing fruit set) was the same in forest fragments and continuous forests. Our results suggest that per-individual and population-level reproduction by understory herbs in tropical forest fragments may be resistant to the detrimental consequences of fragment isolation. Our study also highlights the need to consider how fragmentation influences aspects of population structure and demography beyond abundance and fruit production, because these alternative measures of population structure can be modified in forest fragments in subtle, unexpected ways.},

	abstract = {Decreased recruitment is hypothesized to be a primary mechanism driving the local extinctions of plant species from fragmented landscapes. A critical but untested assumption of this claim is that reductions in fecundity by individual plants actually result in demographic vulnerability at the population level. I tested this ‘‘recruitment limitation hypothesis’’ using three years of census data from 13 populations of the Amazonian understory herb Heliconia acuminata, which I integrated with empirical estimates of seedling establishment into matrix demographic models. I asked: (1) How much recruitment is necessary for ␭ Ͼ 1? (2) What are the projected values of ␭ for H. acuminata populations in fragments and continuous forest, given empirical estimates of seedling emergence? (3) What are the actual values of ␭ for populations in fragments and continuous forest, and why might projected and estimated values of ␭ differ? (4) What other demographic stages contribute to ␭, and how are these affected by fragmentation? Simulation models suggest that extreme reductions in recruitment are necessary for population declines, and empirical estimates of seedling establishment were frequently below these thresholds. As a result, Heliconia acuminata populations in fragments are projected to shrink at a rate of 1–1.5\% per year, while those in continuous forest are projected to grow 2.3–4\% per year. Annual censuses, however, indicated populations in both continuous forest and fragments grew at rates well in excess of those projected by matrix models. This discrepancy is due to higherthan-predicted seedling numbers. While elasticity analyses indicated transitions related to growth and survivorship actually made the greatest proportional contribution to ␭, these results suggest that dispersal into fragments is common and helping populations overcome the negative demographic consequences of reduced seedling establishment. Additional demographic studies of plant populations in fragmented areas are urgently needed to identify other potential mechanisms responsible for population declines. Particular attention should be paid to appraising the effect of fragmentation on plant growth and survivorship, as altering these life-history stages may have the most serious consequences for population growth rates.},

These empirical results were compared with natural patterns of recruitment in permanent 5,000 m2 demographic plots adjacent to experimental areas. The number of naturally occurring seedlings established in demographic plots was 1.5–6 times greater in continuous forest than it was in 1-ha or 10-ha fragments. This result mirrors the pattern of seedling establishment in experimental transects, in which seeds in fragments were 3–7 times less likely to become established than those in continuous forest. Predation of experimentally sown seeds was extremely low at all sites, and is therefore not responsible for the observed pattern. Instead, reductions in seedling abundance in forest fragments are probably due to lower levels of seed germination. Forest fragments have higher air and soil temperatures, lower relative humidity, and increased leaf-litter accumulation, all of which can alter the cues used to initiate germination. While the growth of seedlings was similar in forest fragments and continuous forest, seedling survivorship in fragments was highly variable. These results suggest that altered environmental conditions may exacerbate reductions in plant recruitment resulting from modified plant-animal interactions. Strategies aimed at reducing the intensity of abiotic edge effects should therefore be incorporated into plant conservation efforts.},

However, little is known regarding the demographic mechanisms underlying changes in abundance in fragmented landscapes. Using six years of demographic data collected from {\textgreater} 6600 individuals of the Amazonian understory herb Heliconia acuminata, we calculated population growth rate (lambda) in experimentally isolated 10-ha forest fragments, 1-ha forest fragments, and continuous forest. We then used life-table response experiment analyses to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for observed differences in lambda. On average, lambda approximate to 1.05 in continuous forest, while lambda approximate to 1 in both 1-ha and 10-ha fragments. However, while the differences in X between 10-ha fragments and continuous forest were largely attributable to the negative contribution of stage-specific fertility rates, reduced lambda in 1-ha fragments was due to both reductions in reproductive rates and changes in the rate of plant growth. Our results show that similar reductions in lambda in fragments of different sizes can be driven by distinct demographic mechanisms. Without comprehensive demographic data, attempts to mitigate the decline of populations in fragmented landscapes could be unsuccessful because they might be focusing on inappropriate demographic targets.},

However, distributions of reproductive effort are often underdispersed (i.e., variance {\textbackslash}textless mean). When used in hypothesis tests, models that ignore underdispersion will be overly conservative and may fail to detect significant patterns. Here we show that generalized Poisson (GP) and Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP) distributions are better choices for modeling reproductive effort because they can handle both overdispersion and underdispersion; we provide examples of how ecologists can use GP and CMP distributions in generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to quantify patterns in reproduction. Using a new R package, glmmTMB, we construct GLMMs to investigate how rainfall and population density influence the number of fledglings in the warbler Oreothlypis celata and how flowering rate of Heliconia acuminata differs between fragmented and continuous forest. We also demonstrate how to deal with zero-inflation, which occurs when there are more zeros than expected in the distribution, e.g., due to complete reproductive failure by some individuals.},

A synthesis of fragmentation experiments spanning multiple biomes and scales, five continents, and 35 years demonstrates that habitat fragmentation reduces biodiversity by 13 to 75\% and impairs key ecosystem functions by decreasing biomass and altering nutrient cycles. Effects are greatest in the smallest and most isolated fragments, and they magnify with the passage of time.

	abstract = {1 Tropical forests have highly diverse and often dense understorey vegetation. However, little is known about the demography of tropical understorey species and their response to common events like flooding and gap formation that change the prevailing environmental conditions. 2 We studied the influence of flooding and canopy gaps on the demography of the widespread clonal herb Heliconia metallica in 16 populations in the Peruvian Amazon over two wet and two dry seasons. In a factorial study design, we selected several populations in canopy gaps and under a closed canopy both at flooded and non-flooded sites. 3 Using periodic matrix models, we determined projected population growth rates during seasonal and annual time intervals and applied prospective and retrospective analyses to identify the life cycle components that contributed most to the differences in annual growth rates among the four combinations of habitat conditions. 4 All populations increased in size during the wet and decreased during the dry season. In both years, projected annual growth rates of the non-flooded populations were less than 1 both in gaps and under a closed canopy. In contrast, over the 2-year study period growth rates of the flooded populations were close to 1 both in gaps and under a closed canopy. 5 The life history of H. metallica was dominated by ramet survival and clonal growth, whereas seedling recruitment was very rare. In canopy gaps, growth and clonal expansion were rapid and reproduction was frequent, whereas under a closed canopy ramets grew little and rarely flowered. Population decline at non-flooded sites was due to higher ramet mortality during the dry season. However, the effects of flooding and canopy gaps interacted and affected life-history components differently in wet and dry seasons and in successive years. 6 Synthesis. The intricate interacting effects of flooding and canopy gaps determine the population dynamics of the understorey herb H. metallica. The clonal life form and the plasticity of the ramets enable the populations to persist under variable light conditions, but may not be able to buffer the increasingly frequent periods of drought in Amazon forests.},

Larvae are grossly flattened and morphologically suited for life between the appressed host plant surfaces. Larvae do not burrow into the plant tissues but live and feed from the surface of host organs, as do adults, by reciprocal scraping with the mandibles. Host species specificity varies from monophagous to polyphagous within Zingiberales families for both larvae and adults. Some species change host species geographically. It is rare for one beetle species to attack plants in more than one Zingiberales family. Species richness of beetles is correlated with host-species range, size, and diversity.},

In the validate package, validation rules are objects of computation that can be manipulated, investigated, and confronted with data or versions of a data set. The results of a confrontation are then available for further investigation, summarization or visualization. Validation rules can also be endowed with metadata and documentation and they may be stored or retrieved from external sources such as text files or tabular formats. This data validation infrastructure thus allows for systematic, user-defined definition of data quality requirements that can be reused for various versions of a data set or by data correction algorithms that are parameterized by validation rules.},

Thegeneral appearance and structure of the forest is described together with local topography and soil texture. Thepreliminary results of the Inventory provide a minimum estimate of 698 tree species in 53 families in the 40Km radius sampled, including 17 undescribed species. Themost numerically abundant families, Lecythidaceae, Leguminosae, 5apotaceae and Burseraceae as also among the most species rich families. One aspect of this diverse assemblage is the proliferation of species within certain genera, Including 26 genera In 17 families with 6 or more species or morphospecies. Most species have very low abundances of less than 1 tree per hectare. While more abundant species do exist at densities ranging up to a mean of 12 trees per ha, many have clumped distributions leading to great variation in local species abundance. The degree of similarity between hectare samples based int the Coefficient of Community similarity Index varies widely over different sample hectares for five ecologically different families. Soil texture apparently plays a significant role In determining species composition in the different one hectare plots examined while results for other variable were less consistent. Greater differences in similarity indices are found for comparisons with a one hectare sample within the same formation approximately 40Km to the south. It is concluded that homogeneity of tree community composition within this single large and diverse yet continuous upland forest formation can not be assumed.},

Whether ontogenetic stage also can play a critical role, however, is seldom considered. We address how early-stage survival of two shade-tolerant species is affected by canopy openness, litter depth, ontogenetic stage, and conspeciﬁc neighborhood in the understories of secondary forest fragments in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We monitored the survival of naturally occurring early-stage individuals of one canopy and one understory tree species in six forest fragments for over 2 yr. We then compared how different abiotic and biotic variables, as well as the initial height of seedlings and the length of time interval, inﬂuenced variation in survival using generalized linear mixed-effects models. Survival of the canopy species was negatively affected by light availability, while for the understory species increasing light availability either increased (for seedlings) or decreased (for saplings) survival. In addition, survival of both species at the seedling stage was positively related to litter depth. Finally, we found that conspeciﬁc neighbors were an important biotic factor reducing survival. Our results suggest different regeneration niches for these two tree species related to light availability. Moreover, we found that the effect of both abiotic factors depends on ontogenetic stage, a critical factor for understanding regeneration niches in the forest understory.},

We examined the demographic effects of habitat fragmentation by comparing the population dynamics of the late-successional tree Poulsenia armata (Moraceae) in southern Mexico between a continuous forest and several forest fragments using integral projection models (IPMs) during 2010–2012. Forest fragmentation did not lead to differences in population density and even resulted in a higher population-growth rate (λ) in fragments compared to continuous forests. Habitat fragmentation had drastic effects on the dynamics of P. armata, causing the population structure to shift toward smaller sizes. Fragmented populations experienced a significant decrease in juvenile survival and growth compared to unaltered populations. Adult survival and growth made the greatest relative contributions to λ in both habitat types during 2011–2012. However, the relative importance of juvenile survival and growth to λ was highest in the fragmented forest in 2010–2011. Our Life Table Response Experiment analysis revealed that positive contributions of adult fecundity explained most of the variation of λ between both habitats and annual periods. Finally, P. armata has a relatively slow speed of recovery after disturbances, compromising persistence of fragmented populations. Developing a mechanistic understanding of how forest fragmentation affects plant population dynamics, as done here, will prove essential for the preservation of natural areas.},

	abstract = {Forest fragmentation may have positive or negative effects on tropical tree populations. Our earlier study of an endemic African tree, Leptonychia usambarensis (Sterculiaceae), in the East Usambara Mountains of Tanzania, found poorer recruitment of seedlings and juveniles in small fragments compared to continuous forest, and concomitant reduction of seed-dispersal agents and seed dispersal. However, the possibility that other biotic or abiotic consequences of the fragmentation process contribute to diminished recruitment in fragments was left open. Here we test whether excessive seed predation, diminished fecundity, low seed quality, or adverse abiotic effects acted independently or in concert with reduced seed dispersal to limit seedling and juvenile recruitment in fragments. Extended observations of disperser activity, a seed placement experiment, seed predator censuses, and reciprocal seedling transplants from forest and fragment sources failed to support the alternative hypotheses for poorer seedling and juvenile recruitment in fragments, leaving reduced seed dispersal as the most plausible mechanism. Poorer recruitment of this species in forest fragments, where high edge-to-area ratios admit more light than in continuous forest, is particularly striking because the tree is an early successional species that might be expected to thrive in disturbed microhabitats.},

	abstract = {Studies conducted in forests have resulted in much of the ecological theory we build upon today. However, our basic understanding of forest ecology comes almost exclusively from the study of trees, even though they represent only a small fraction of the plant diversity present in forests. In recent decades there has been an increasing number of studies of forest herbs, broadening our understanding of plant community ecology in forest ecosystems. Here we highlight ten recent studies examining patterns and drivers of, as well as threats to, herbaceous plant diversity in forests. We first examine local, regional, and global patterns of herbaceous diversity in forests and how such patterns differ for woody versus herbaceous species. We then focus on ecological mechanisms that contribute to forest herb diversity, including the role of abiotic and biotic interactions. We end by discussing some major anthropogenic impacts on forest herb diversity, identifying where herbs are particularly susceptible or particularly resilient to current and predicted changes in comparison to trees. The studies we feature demonstrate that patterns and drivers of diversity often differ between woody and herbaceous plant communities. To facilitate cross-site comparisons, there is great need for more standardized survey methods for herbaceous plants, for simultaneous measurements of multiple plant growth forms, and for incorporating herbs into long-term forest monitoring networks. In addition, the selected studies reveal how land-use history, overabundant herbivores, invasive species, and climate change are all impacting forest herb communities. Some common characteristics of herbaceous plants, such as limited dispersal and small stature, may make forest herb communities more susceptible to these anthropogenic impacts, while others (e.g., resprouting ability, clonal reproduction) may make them more resilient compared to forest trees. More research is needed from both plant ecologists and applied forest practitioners to predict how herbaceous forest diversity will change in the future.},

We conducted a 3-year experiment in which we simulated the stem harvesting of the Amazonian plant Ischnosiphon polyphyllus, which is used by traditional and indigenous populations in the Amazon for the construction of baskets, mats, and other handicrafts used in manioc cultivation. We found that plant mortality is limited in all except the most extreme harvesting treatments. However, we also found that plants recuperate extremely slowly from experimental harvesting. These results suggest that current harvesting strategies may not be conservative enough to ensure long-term population survival.},

	abstract = {Sustainable harvest of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) can play an important role in biodiversity conservation and livelihoods. However, harvesting policy intended to promote conservation are frequently either ineffective or too complicated. Successful policies should consider ecological impacts, local ecological knowledge and management practices, but NTFP policies are rarely based on these elements. Syngonanthus nitens (Eriocaulaceae, ‘golden-grass’) is one of the most valuable NTFPs from the Brazilian savanna. The handicrafts made from this species’ flower stalks are traditional to the Jalapão region, Tocantins state, but have expanded over a much larger area in recent years. We combined ethnoecological interviews, seed phenology surveys over a large geographical area and harvest experiments in nine sites over 3years to assess local ecological knowledge and management of golden-grass and its long-term effects on population dynamics. Although handicrafting activities are rapidly expanding, local ecological knowledge associated with harvest or management has not been transferred or created outside of Jalapão. Matrix population models illustrate that harvest according to traditional management practices had no impact on golden-grass population dynamics. Earlier harvest of golden-grass, as practiced by new artisans, leads to population decline due to plant uprooting. Local policies for golden-grass harvest are consistent with traditional management, limit the timing but not the quantity of harvest, and are appropriate over a wide geographical scale. Golden-grass and other wild harvested species with similar characteristics hold high potential to help conserve threatened habitat.},

Together, the fluxes comprise a net global forest sink of 1.1 ± 0.8 Pg C year–1, with tropical estimates having the largest uncertainties.

However, many uncertainties about the spatial distribution of live tree above-ground biomass (AGB) remain, mostly due to limited availability of AGB field data. Recent studies in the Amazon have already shown the importance of large sample size for accurate AGB gradient analysis. Here we use a large stem density, basal area, community wood density and AGB dataset to study and explain their spatial patterns in an Asian tropical forest. Location Borneo, Southeast Asia. Methods We combined stem density, basal area, community wood density and AGB data from 83 locations in Borneo with an environmental database containing elevation, climate and soil variables. The Akaike information criterion was used to select models and environmental variables that best explained the observed values of stem density, basal area, community wood density and AGB. These models were used to extrapolate these parameters across Borneo. Results We found that wood density, stem density, basal area and AGB respond significantly, but differentially, to the environment. AGB was only correlated with basal area, but not with stem density and community wood specific gravity. Main conclusions Unlike results from Amazonian forests, soil fertility was an important positive correlate for AGB in Borneo while community wood density, which is a main driver of AGB in the Neotropics, did not correlate with AGB in Borneo. Also, Borneo's average AGB of 457.1 Mg ha−1 was c. 60\% higher than the Amazonian average of 288.6 Mg ha−1. We find evidence that this difference might be partly explained by the high density of large wind-dispersed Dipterocarpaceae in Borneo, which need to be tall and emergent to disperse their seeds. Our results emphasize the importance of Bornean forests as carbon sinks and sources due to their high carbon storage capacity.},

We studied the relationship between aboveground tree biomass dynamics (Δbiomass) and multiple dimensions of biodiversity over 8–16 years in eight successional rainforests. We tested whether successional changes in diversity–Δbiomass correlations reflect predictions of niche theories. Diversity–Δbiomass correlations were positive early but weak later in succession, suggesting saturation of niche space with increasing diversity. Early in succession, phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity in two leaf traits exhibited the strongest positive correlations with Δbiomass, indicating complementarity or positive selection effects. In mid-successional stands, high biodiversity was associated with greater mortality-driven biomass loss, i.e. negative selection effects, suggesting successional niche trade-offs and loss of fast-growing pioneer species. Our results demonstrate that BEF relationships are dynamic across succession, thus successional context is essential to understanding BEF in a given system.},
