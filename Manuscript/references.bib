	abstract = {Ecologists commonly use matrix models to study the population dynamics of plants. Most studies of plant demography use plot-based methods to collect data, in part, because mapped individuals are easier to relocate in subsequent surveys and survey methods can be standardized among sites. However, there is tremendous variation among studies, both in terms of plot arrangement and the total area sampled. In addition, there has been little discussion of how alternative sampling arrangements influence estimates of population growth rates (lambda) calculated with matrix models. We surveyed the literature to determine what sampling designs are most used in studies of plant demography using matrix models. We then used simulations of three common sampling techniques-using a single randomly placed plot, multiple randomly placed plots, and systematically distributed plots-to evaluate how these alternative strategies influenced the precision of estimates of lambda. These simulations were based on long-term demographic data collected on 13 populations of the Amazonian understory herb Heliconia acuminate (Heliconiaceae). We found that the method used to collect data did not affect the bias or precision of estimates in our system-a surprising result, since the advantage in efficiency that is gained from systematic sampling is a well-known result from sampling theory. Because the statistical advantage of systematic sampling is most evident when there is spatial structure in demographic vital rates, we attribute this result to the lack of spatially structured vital rates in our focal populations. Given the likelihood of spatial autocorrelation in most ecological systems, we advocate sampling with a systematic grid of plots in each study site, as well as that researchers ensure that enough area is sampled-both within and across sites-to encompass the range of spatial variation in plant survival, growth, and reproduction.},

	abstract = {Habitat fragmentation is a leading cause of extinction, with effects that may be particularly pronounced in tropical ecosystems. However, little is known regarding the demographic mechanisms underlying changes in abundance in fragmented landscapes. Using six years of demographic data collected from {\textgreater} 6600 individuals of the Amazonian understory herb Heliconia acuminata, we calculated population growth rate (lambda) in experimentally isolated 10-ha forest fragments, 1-ha forest fragments, and continuous forest. We then used life-table response experiment analyses to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for observed differences in lambda. On average, lambda approximate to 1.05 in continuous forest, while lambda approximate to 1 in both 1-ha and 10-ha fragments. However, while the differences in X between 10-ha fragments and continuous forest were largely attributable to the negative contribution of stage-specific fertility rates, reduced lambda in 1-ha fragments was due to both reductions in reproductive rates and changes in the rate of plant growth. Our results show that similar reductions in lambda in fragments of different sizes can be driven by distinct demographic mechanisms. Without comprehensive demographic data, attempts to mitigate the decline of populations in fragmented landscapes could be unsuccessful because they might be focusing on inappropriate demographic targets.},

	abstract = {In theory, conservation genetics predicts that forest fragmentation will reduce gene dispersal, but in practice, genetic and ecological processes are also dependent on other population characteristics. We used Bayesian genetic analyses to characterize parentage and propagule dispersal in Heliconia acuminata L. C. Richard (Heliconiaceae), a common Amazonian understory plant that is pollinated and dispersed by birds. We studied these processes in two continuous forest sites and three 1-ha fragments in Brazil's Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project. These sites showed variation in the density of H. acuminata. Ten microsatellite markers were used to genotype flowering adults and seedling recruits and to quantify realized pollen and seed dispersal distances, immigration of propagules from outside populations, and reproductive dominance among parents. We tested whether gene dispersal is more dependent on fragmentation or density of reproductive plants. Low plant densities were associated with elevated immigration rates and greater propagule dispersal distances. Reproductive dominance among inside-plot parents was higher for low-density than for high-density populations. Elevated local flower and fruit availability is probably leading to spatially more proximal bird foraging and propagule dispersal in areas with high density of reproductive plants. Nevertheless, genetic diversity, inbreeding coefficients and fine-scale spatial genetic structure were similar across populations, despite differences in gene dispersal. This result may indicate that the opposing processes of longer dispersal events in low-density populations vs. higher diversity of contributing parents in high-density populations balance the resulting genetic outcomes and prevent genetic erosion in small populations and fragments.},

	abstract = {Reproduction by individuals is typically recorded as count data (e.g., number of fledglings from a nest or inflorescences on a plant) and commonly modeled using Poisson or negative binomial distributions, which assume that variance is greater than or equal to the mean. However, distributions of reproductive effort are often underdispersed (i.e., variance {\textbackslash}textless mean). When used in hypothesis tests, models that ignore underdispersion will be overly conservative and may fail to detect significant patterns. Here we show that generalized Poisson (GP) and Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP) distributions are better choices for modeling reproductive effort because they can handle both overdispersion and underdispersion; we provide examples of how ecologists can use GP and CMP distributions in generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to quantify patterns in reproduction. Using a new R package, glmmTMB, we construct GLMMs to investigate how rainfall and population density influence the number of fledglings in the warbler Oreothlypis celata and how flowering rate of Heliconia acuminata differs between fragmented and continuous forest. We also demonstrate how to deal with zero-inflation, which occurs when there are more zeros than expected in the distribution, e.g., due to complete reproductive failure by some individuals.},

We surveyed the ecological literature to determine what components of plant demography have been studied in fragmented habitats, and determined the elasticity values of the vital rates inﬂuenced by these components. We found that there is a major disparity between the ecological processes and stages of life history with large demographic impacts and the focus of empirical research on plants in fragmented habitats. While the growth and survivorship of large, established individuals have the highest elasticity values, the focus of empirical research has been on components of reproduction and seedling dynamics. We argue that elucidating the demographic mechanisms underlying population declines in fragmented habitats, and developing strategies for mitigating these declines, will be challenging without a greater focus on understanding how fragmentation alters adult plant growth and survivorship.},

However, the potential impact of changing climatic variability on the fate of populations has been largely unexamined. We analyzed multiyear demographic data for 36 plant and animal species with a broad range of life histories and types of environment to ask how sensitive their long-term stochastic population growth rates are likely to be to changes in the means and standard deviations of vital rates (survival, reproduction, growth) in response to changing climate. We quantiﬁed responsiveness using elasticities of the long-term population growth rate predicted by stochastic projection matrix models. Short-lived species (insects and annual plants and algae) are predicted to be more strongly (and negatively) affected by increasing vital rate variability relative to longer-lived species (perennial plants, birds, ungulates). Taxonomic afﬁliation has little power to explain sensitivity to increasing variability once longevity has been taken into account. Our results highlight the potential vulnerability of short-lived species to an increasingly variable climate, but also suggest that problems associated with short-lived undesirable species (agricultural pests, disease vectors, invasive weedy plants) may be exacerbated in regions where climate variability decreases.},

	abstract = {Background: Matrix models are widely used to study the dynamics and demography of populations. An important but overlooked issue is how the number of individuals sampled influences estimates of the population growth rate (l) calculated with matrix models. Even unbiased estimates of vital rates do not ensure unbiased estimates of l–Jensen’s Inequality implies that even when the estimates of the vital rates are accurate, small sample sizes lead to biased estimates of l due to increased sampling variance. We investigated if sampling variability and the distribution of sampling effort among size classes lead to biases in estimates of l. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using data from a long-term field study of plant demography, we simulated the effects of sampling variance by drawing vital rates and calculating l for increasingly larger populations drawn from a total population of 3842 plants. We then compared these estimates of l with those based on the entire population and calculated the resulting bias. Finally, we conducted a review of the literature to determine the sample sizes typically used when parameterizing matrix models used to study plant demography. Conclusions/Significance: We found significant bias at small sample sizes when survival was low (survival = 0.5), and that sampling with a more-realistic inverse J-shaped population structure exacerbated this bias. However our simulations also demonstrate that these biases rapidly become negligible with increasing sample sizes or as survival increases. For many of the sample sizes used in demographic studies, matrix models are probably robust to the biases resulting from sampling variance of vital rates. However, this conclusion may depend on the structure of populations or the distribution of sampling effort in ways that are unexplored. We suggest more intensive sampling of populations when individual survival is low and greater sampling of stages with high elasticities.},

	abstract = {Decreased recruitment is hypothesized to be a primary mechanism driving the local extinctions of plant species from fragmented landscapes. A critical but untested assumption of this claim is that reductions in fecundity by individual plants actually result in demographic vulnerability at the population level. I tested this ‘‘recruitment limitation hypothesis’’ using three years of census data from 13 populations of the Amazonian understory herb Heliconia acuminata, which I integrated with empirical estimates of seedling establishment into matrix demographic models. I asked: (1) How much recruitment is necessary for ␭ Ͼ 1? (2) What are the projected values of ␭ for H. acuminata populations in fragments and continuous forest, given empirical estimates of seedling emergence? (3) What are the actual values of ␭ for populations in fragments and continuous forest, and why might projected and estimated values of ␭ differ? (4) What other demographic stages contribute to ␭, and how are these affected by fragmentation? Simulation models suggest that extreme reductions in recruitment are necessary for population declines, and empirical estimates of seedling establishment were frequently below these thresholds. As a result, Heliconia acuminata populations in fragments are projected to shrink at a rate of 1–1.5\% per year, while those in continuous forest are projected to grow 2.3–4\% per year. Annual censuses, however, indicated populations in both continuous forest and fragments grew at rates well in excess of those projected by matrix models. This discrepancy is due to higherthan-predicted seedling numbers. While elasticity analyses indicated transitions related to growth and survivorship actually made the greatest proportional contribution to ␭, these results suggest that dispersal into fragments is common and helping populations overcome the negative demographic consequences of reduced seedling establishment. Additional demographic studies of plant populations in fragmented areas are urgently needed to identify other potential mechanisms responsible for population declines. Particular attention should be paid to appraising the effect of fragmentation on plant growth and survivorship, as altering these life-history stages may have the most serious consequences for population growth rates.},

We tested (A) whether annual growth rates were lower in fragments than in continuous forest, and (B) whether cumulative growth rates of plants that survived the entire period were lower in fragments. While mean annual growth rates were often lower in fragments, differences were not signiﬁcant in any year. After 10 years, however, the cumulative effect was that plants in fragments were signiﬁcantly smaller. This had a clear demographic consequence – plants in fragments produced fewer inﬂorescences than plants in continuous forest.

Over the past 32 years, Amazonian forest fragments ranging from 1 to 100 ha have experienced a wide array of ecological changes. Edge effects have been a dominant driver of fragment dynamics, strongly affecting forest microclimate, tree mortality, carbon storage, fauna, and other aspects of fragment ecology. However, edge-effect intensity varies markedly in space and time, and is inﬂuenced by factors such as edge age, the number of nearby edges, and the adjoining matrix of modiﬁed vegetation surrounding fragments. In our study area, the matrix has changed markedly over the course of the study (evolving from large cattle pastures to mosaics of abandoned pasture and regrowth forest) and this in turn has strongly inﬂuenced fragment dynamics and faunal persistence. Rare weather events, especially windstorms and droughts, have further altered fragment ecology. In general, populations and communities of species in fragments are hyperdynamic relative to nearby intact forest. Some edge and fragment-isolation effects have declined with a partial recovery of secondary forests around fragments, but other changes, such as altered patterns of tree recruitment, are ongoing. Fragments are highly sensitive to external vicissitudes, and even small changes in local land-management practices may drive fragmented ecosystems in markedly different directions. The effects of fragmentation are likely to interact synergistically with other anthropogenic threats such as logging, hunting, and especially ﬁre, creating an even greater peril for the Amazonian biota.},

	abstract = {Deforestation often results in landscapes where remaining forest habitat is highly fragmented, with remnants of different sizes embedded in an often highly contrasting matrix. Local extinction of species from individual fragments is common, but the demographic mechanisms underlying these extinctions are poorly understood. It is often hypothesized that altered environmental conditions in fragments drive declines in reproduction, recruitment, or survivorship. The Amazon basin, in addition to experiencing continuing fragmentation, is experiencing climate change-related increases in the frequency and intensity of droughts and unusually wet periods. Whether plant populations in tropical forest fragments are particularly susceptible to extremes in precipitation remains unclear. Most studies of plants in fragments are relatively short (1-6 years), focus on a single life-history stage, and often do not compare to populations in continuous forest. Even fewer studies consider delayed effects of climate on demographic vital rates despite the importance of delayed effects in studies that consider them. Using a decade of demographic and climate data from an experimentally fragmented landscape in the Central Amazon, we assess the effects of climate on populations of an understory herb (Heliconia acuminata, Heliconiaceae). We used distributed lag nonlinear models to understand the delayed effects of climate (measured as standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index, SPEI) on survival, growth, and flowering. We detected delayed effects of climate up to 36 months. Extremes in SPEI in the previous year reduced survival, drought in the wet season 8-11 months prior to the February census increased growth, and drought two dry seasons prior increased flowering probability. Effects of extremes in precipitation on survival and growth were more pronounced in forest fragments compared to continuous forest. The complex delayed effects of climate and habitat fragmentation in our study point to the importance of long-term demography experiments in understanding the effects of anthropogenic change on plant populations.},

It has previously been shown that the woody species community in secondary forests can follow different successional pathways according to the nature of past human activities in the area, yet little is known about patterns of herbaceous species diversity in secondary forests with different histories of land use. We compared the diversity and abundance of herbaceous plant communities in two types of Central Amazonian secondary forests—those regenerating on pastures created by felling and burning trees and those where trees were felled only. We also tested if plant density and species richness in secondary forests are related to proximity to primary forest. In comparison with primary forest sites, forests regenerating on non-burned habitats had lower herbaceous plant density and species richness than those on burned ones. However, species composition and abundance in non-burned stands were more similar to those of primary forest, whereas several secondary forest specialist species were found in burned stands. In both non-burned and burned forests, distance from the forest edge was not related to herbaceous density and species richness. Overall, our results suggest that the natural regeneration of herbaceous species in secondary tropical forests is dependent on a site’s postclearing treatment. We recommend evaluating the land history of a site prior to developing and implementing a restoration strategy, as this will inﬂuence the biological template on which restoration efforts are overlaid.},

Our analyses demonstrated a large degree of variation in seed production, dispersal, and establishment among and within the 10 study plots. Seed production limitation was strong but only at small spatial scales. Average dispersal distance was less than 4 m, leading to severe dispersal limitation at most sites. Overall, safe-site limitation was the most important constraint on seedling establishment. Fragmentation led to a more heterogeneous light environment with negative consequences for seedling establishment but had little effect on seed production or dispersal. These results suggest that the effects of fragmentation on abiotic processes may be more important than the disruption of biotic interactions in driving biodiversity loss in tropical forests, at least for some functional groups. These effects may be common when the matrix surrounding fragments contains enough tree cover to enable movement of dispersers and pollinators.},

	abstract = {Seed dispersal is a crucial component of plant population dynamics. Human landscape modiﬁcations, such as habitat destruction and fragmentation, can alter the abundance of fruiting plants and animal dispersers, foraging rates, vector movement, and the composition of the disperser community, all of which can singly or in concert affect seed dispersal. Here, we quantify and tease apart the effects of landscape conﬁguration, namely, fragmentation of primary forest and the composition of the surrounding forest matrix, on individual components of seed dispersal of Heliconia acuminata, an Amazonian understory herb. First we identiﬁed the effects of landscape conﬁguration on the abundance of fruiting plants and six bird disperser species. Although highly variable in space and time, densities of fruiting plants were similar in continuous forest and fragments. However, the two largestbodied avian dispersers were less common or absent in small fragments. Second, we determined whether fragmentation affected foraging rates. Fruit removal rates were similar and very high across the landscape, suggesting that Heliconia fruits are a key resource for small frugivores in this landscape. Third, we used radiotelemetry and statistical models to quantify how landscape conﬁguration inﬂuences vector movement patterns. Bird dispersers ﬂew farther and faster, and perched longer in primary relative to secondary forests. One species also altered its movement direction in response to habitat boundaries between primary and secondary forests. Finally, we parameterized a simulation model linking data on fruit density and disperser abundance and behavior with empirical estimates of seed retention times to generate seed dispersal patterns in two hypothetical landscapes. Despite clear changes in bird movement in response to landscape conﬁguration, our simulations demonstrate that these differences had negligible effects on dispersal distances. However, small fragments had reduced densities of Turdus albicollis, the largest-bodied disperser and the only one to both regurgitate and defecate seeds. This change in Turdus abundance acted together with lower numbers of fruiting plants in small fragments to decrease the probability of long-distance dispersal events from small patches. These ﬁndings emphasize the importance of foraging style for seed dispersal and highlight the primacy of habitat size relative to spatial conﬁguration in preserving biotic interactions.},

By assessing the population structure of a common herb ( Heliconia acuminata) in an experimentally fragmented landscape in the central Amazon, we tested the predictions that fragmentation could reduce population density, alter population structure, and reduce reproductive effort. Population density in continuous forest varied six-fold, some areas having high density and others low density. Population density in small fragments and on the edges of large fragments was often low, but it was within the range of densities found in continuous forest, and the difference between locations was not significant. Heliconia populations in forest fragments were skewed toward smaller demographic size classes, however. Because reproduction in H. acuminata is positively correlated with plant size, these shifts were predicted to result in fewer flowering plants in forest fragments. The proportion of the population flowering in forest fragments and continuous forest was not significantly different, although there was a trend toward proportionately greater flowering in continuous forest. For plants that did flower, per-individual reproductive success (measured as developing fruit set) was the same in forest fragments and continuous forests. Our results suggest that per-individual and population-level reproduction by understory herbs in tropical forest fragments may be resistant to the detrimental consequences of fragment isolation. Our study also highlights the need to consider how fragmentation influences aspects of population structure and demography beyond abundance and fruit production, because these alternative measures of population structure can be modified in forest fragments in subtle, unexpected ways.},

	abstract = {I present the results of a 2-year experiment comparing seed predation, seed germination, and seedling survivorship patterns of the Amazonian understory herb Heliconia acuminata in forest fragments and continuous forest. These empirical results were compared with natural patterns of recruitment in permanent 5,000 m2 demographic plots adjacent to experimental areas. The number of naturally occurring seedlings established in demographic plots was 1.5–6 times greater in continuous forest than it was in 1-ha or 10-ha fragments. This result mirrors the pattern of seedling establishment in experimental transects, in which seeds in fragments were 3–7 times less likely to become established than those in continuous forest. Predation of experimentally sown seeds was extremely low at all sites, and is therefore not responsible for the observed pattern. Instead, reductions in seedling abundance in forest fragments are probably due to lower levels of seed germination. Forest fragments have higher air and soil temperatures, lower relative humidity, and increased leaf-litter accumulation, all of which can alter the cues used to initiate germination. While the growth of seedlings was similar in forest fragments and continuous forest, seedling survivorship in fragments was highly variable. These results suggest that altered environmental conditions may exacerbate reductions in plant recruitment resulting from modified plant-animal interactions. Strategies aimed at reducing the intensity of abiotic edge effects should therefore be incorporated into plant conservation efforts.},
